# Case Study: SmartPrint for GigEfx Laboratories

## 1) Client + context
**Client:** GigEfx Laboratories  
**Domain:** Additive manufacturing / 3D printing operations  
**Goal:** Reduce failed prints and quantify the business value of simulation-driven improvements.

## 2) Problem statement
GigEfx faced recurring inefficiencies in the 3D printing workflow that typically show up as:
- reprints and wasted material
- long cycle times and unpredictable throughput
- unclear ROI for adopting simulation technologies

We needed to answer:
1) What are the biggest drivers of inefficiency?
2) If failure rates/cycle times improve, what is the expected time and cost impact?
3) How should a stakeholder decide whether to invest in simulation tools?

## 3) What we delivered
### A) Streamlit simulation model (decision support)
- Scenario sliders to test assumptions (failure rate, cost inputs, time inputs)
- Outputs that translate assumptions into executive metrics (time saved, cost saved, ROI logic)

### B) Tableau dashboard (analytics)
- A visual breakdown of sub-issues and drivers
- Filters for stakeholder exploration and storytelling

### C) Business case + final presentation
- Framing, options, assumptions, risks, and a recommended path forward

## 4) Approach (high level)
- Gathered/estimated the key operational parameters and cost drivers
- Built a simulation/what-if model to quantify impact under uncertainty
- Created visuals for “executive consumption” (Tableau + slide story)
- Recommended next steps for operational measurement & model calibration

## 5) How to talk about impact (recruiter-friendly)
Even if you can’t share proprietary numbers publicly, you can still communicate:
- the decision the model supports
- the levers and sensitivity analysis
- how your dashboard changed stakeholder understanding
- what implementation steps you proposed

## 6) Next steps (if this were continued)
- Connect the model to real print logs (failure codes, time stamps, material usage)
- Validate assumptions and quantify confidence intervals
- Add structured sensitivity (tornado chart) + Monte Carlo for uncertainty
- Expand to include scheduling constraints and machine utilization
